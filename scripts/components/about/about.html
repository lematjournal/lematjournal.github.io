   <h1 class="text-center title">LE MAT POST-JOKE NON-MANIFESTO</h1>
   <br>
   <p class="about-text">Le Mat is a non-philosophical enterprise that programmatically exploits its own ignorance in the name of annihilating—aesthetically and discursively—the “subject of science” or a “subject supposed to know” which has haunted philosophical and artistic discourse. Le Mat decisively locates itself as the obverse of this subject; by making it speak it deploys an unconscious strategy of subverting or exiting their (philosophy and art’s) linear dialectics of negation/deconstruction as a wager that, by knowing nothing at all, it situates itself in the position of truth. Thus, it engages a dehiscent discourse emerging in the real or recognized absence of this subject of science—a situation which authorizes—proscribes the generative program/analytic practice of dialectically anticipating, reproducing, and directing the negativizing effects of this absence as a strategy of anti-pedagogical and anti-humanist dissemination of a “problem set” or a “program of research” informed our elected discursive procedures in the domains of psychoanalysis, aesthetics, politics, etc.</p>
   <br>
   <p class="about-text">Thus, Le Mat is a [de]regulated cybernetics of the discursive effects of ignorance, a playful Jacobinism-Reagonomics (Reacobinism) in the political economy of philosophy which simultaneously decenters as it aggregates the remnants of the philosophical state’s [logo]centralized humanist discursive apparatus—undoing and exposing philosophy’s various decisions and deploying it in the name of our aesthetic and political practices—heretofore parasitized for philosophy’s own purposes (namely, to validate and exercise the Principle of Sufficient Philosophy) and used to scaffold its degenerating program of research.</p>
   <br>
   <p class="about-text">In a word, Le Mat makes extensive use of Evil (reflexivity, infinite exchangeability, spiraling negativity, undecidability, undeconstructability, etc.) as a part of its philosophical conspiracy to establish localized hallucinogenic epistemologies, agitate, or produce “revolutionary flows” by engaging a set of philosophical reciprocally redefined pragmatics (Lacauzian, Delecanian, Dergelian, and Herridian) as the groundwork for an as-yet-unknown and nonspecific democratic/democratizing project.</p>
